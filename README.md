# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a classic example of ancient cryptography that involves shifting each letter of a plain-text message by a certain number of letters. It is a type of substitution cipher where one letter is substituted for another in a consistent fashion.


For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in private correspondence.
